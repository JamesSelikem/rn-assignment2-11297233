## Overview
This React Native app demonstrates how to perform basic styling tasks such as changing the background color and editing text. 

## Tasks
### Background Color Toggle:
For this task I was to change the the background color of the app from white and to any color. I set the backgroundColor property in the styles.container style object to '#0000ff', which is the hex code for blue.

### Text Styling:
For this  task i was to edit the text with increased font size and bold formatting.To begin, i changed the give text to display the tet "My name is James". A new style object named text is then added to the styles object. It contains the fontSize property set to 24.The name "James" is then wrapped in a nested Text component within the main Text component.I then added a new style named bold to the styles object with fontWeight: 'bold'.
